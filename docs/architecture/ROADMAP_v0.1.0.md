## Beyond v0.1.0

### v0.2.0: Remote Optimization

**Focus**: Optimize remote sync performance

- Network protocol improvements
- Parallel chunk transfers for large files
- Resume support for remote sync
- Compression tuning for WAN
- QUIC protocol support (if beneficial)

### v0.3.0: Cloud Integration

**Focus**: Cloud storage support

- S3-compatible storage
- Azure Blob Storage
- Google Cloud Storage
- Wasabi, Backblaze B2

### v0.4.0: Advanced Features

**Focus**: Power user features

- Snapshot support (APFS/BTRFS)
- Deduplication
- Encryption at rest
- Bandwidth scheduling
- Custom filters and hooks

### v1.0.0: Production Release

**Focus**: Stability and long-term support

- LTS commitment (long-term support)
- Stable API guarantees
- Backward compatibility promises
- Enterprise features (audit logs, compliance)

## Non-Goals for v0.1.0

**Explicitly NOT including**:

- Cloud storage support (v0.3.0)
- Encryption at rest (v0.4.0)
- Snapshot support (v0.4.0)
- QUIC protocol (v0.2.0)
- Deduplication (v0.4.0)
- GUI/web interface (post-1.0)

**Rationale**: Focus on core file synchronization first, add advanced features later.

## Risk Assessment

### High Risk Items

1. **Windows compatibility**: Untested, may have platform-specific bugs
   - Mitigation: Dedicate v0.0.26 to Windows testing

2. **Performance regression**: Complex optimizations may have edge cases
   - Mitigation: Comprehensive benchmarking in CI

3. **Data corruption**: Delta sync is complex and error-prone
   - Mitigation: Extensive testing, fuzzing, production use

### Medium Risk Items

1. **Platform fragmentation**: Different behaviors on different filesystems
   - Mitigation: Comprehensive FILESYSTEM_SUPPORT.md documentation

2. **Feature creep**: Too many features before stability
   - Mitigation: Strict roadmap discipline

### Low Risk Items

1. **Documentation**: Already comprehensive
2. **Testing**: Good coverage, can improve
3. **Performance**: Already excellent

## Decision Points

### Should we release v0.1.0 sooner?

**Arguments for**:
- Core functionality is stable
- Performance is excellent
- macOS/Linux work well

**Arguments against**:
- Windows untested
- Limited production use
- Missing some planned features

**Decision**: Wait for full roadmap completion. Better to delay and get it right than rush and have bugs.

### Should we skip 0.0.x and go straight to 0.1.0?

**Arguments for**:
- Semantic versioning says 0.1.0 is appropriate
- Already production-ready on macOS/Linux

**Arguments against**:
- Not battle-tested enough
- Windows not verified
- Need more real-world use

**Decision**: Continue with 0.0.x until all criteria met. Version number is less important than quality.

## Community Engagement

### Current Status

- **GitHub stars**: Track growth
- **Issues**: Responsive to bug reports
- **Pull requests**: Welcome contributions
- **Discussions**: Answer questions

### v0.1.0 Goals

- **100+ GitHub stars**: Community validation
- **10+ contributors**: Diverse contributions
- **Active Discord/Slack**: Community support
- **Production users**: Real-world adoption

## Conclusion

**v0.1.0 is a major milestone** representing the completion of core file synchronization functionality with production-ready quality.

**The roadmap is ambitious** but achievable with disciplined execution and focus on quality over speed.

**Current progress is excellent** - v0.0.25 has solid foundations for the journey to v0.1.0.

**Timeline is realistic** - 10-15 months allows for thorough testing, cross-platform support, and production hardening.

**Success is measured** not by version number but by quality, reliability, and user satisfaction.
