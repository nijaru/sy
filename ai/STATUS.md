# Status

_Last Updated: 2025-10-21_

## Current State
- Version: v0.0.35 (in development)
- Phase: Phase 5b (Checksum Database) - Foundation complete, integration in progress
- Test Coverage: 325 tests passing (317 lib + 8 checksumdb)
- Build: Passing (all tests green)
- Performance: 1.3x - 8.8x faster than rsync (see docs/PERFORMANCE.md)

## Implemented Features
- âœ… Local and remote (SSH) sync
- âœ… Delta sync with COW optimization (v0.0.23)
- âœ… Filesystem-aware strategy selection
- âœ… Hard link preservation
- âœ… Parallel file transfers
- âœ… Compression (zstd)
- âœ… Progress display with colors
- âœ… Gitignore awareness
- âœ… JSON output
- âœ… Config profiles
- âœ… Watch mode
- âœ… Resume support
- âœ… Performance monitoring (--perf flag, v0.0.33)
- âœ… Comprehensive error reporting (v0.0.34)
- âœ… Pre-transfer checksums (--checksum flag, v0.0.35) - localâ†’local, saves bandwidth!

## What Worked
- **Local delta sync optimization** (v0.0.23): Using simple block comparison instead of rolling hash for localâ†’local sync achieved 5-9x speedup
- **COW-aware strategies**: Automatic filesystem detection and strategy selection prevents data corruption
- **Performance monitoring**: Arc<Mutex<PerformanceMonitor>> with atomic counters provides thread-safe metrics without overhead
- **Error collection**: Collecting errors in Vec<SyncError> during parallel execution gives users comprehensive view of all failures
- **Documentation reorganization**: Following agent-contexts v0.1.1 patterns with docs/architecture/ and ai/ separation provides clear structure and knowledge graduation path
- **Comprehensive documentation**: Documenting new features (--perf, error reporting) immediately after implementation helps users discover and use them
- **Pre-transfer checksums** (v0.0.35): Computing xxHash3 checksums during planning phase before transfer saves bandwidth on re-syncs and detects bit rot

## What Didn't Work
- QUIC transport: 45% slower than TCP on fast networks (>600 Mbps) - documented in DESIGN.md
- Compression on local/high-speed: CPU bottleneck negates benefits above 4Gbps
- Initial sparse file tests: Had to make filesystem-agnostic due to varying FS support

## Active Work
- ðŸš§ Implementing Phase 5b: Checksum Database (v0.0.35/36)
  - âœ… Added rusqlite dependency (v0.31 with bundled SQLite)
  - âœ… Implemented ChecksumDatabase module with full SQLite backend
  - âœ… Created schema: path, mtime, size, checksum_type, checksum, updated_at
  - âœ… Implemented get_checksum(), store_checksum(), clear(), prune(), stats()
  - âœ… Added CLI flags: --checksum-db, --clear-checksum-db, --prune-checksum-db
  - âœ… 8 comprehensive tests for database operations (all passing)
  - ðŸš§ Need: Integrate database with SyncEngine
  - ðŸš§ Need: Update StrategyPlanner to use cached checksums
  - ðŸš§ Need: Store checksums after successful transfers
  - ðŸš§ Need: End-to-end testing with --checksum-db flag

- âœ… Completed Phase 5a: Pre-Transfer Checksums (v0.0.35)
  - All features complete and tested
  - Documentation comprehensive
  - Remote support deferred to future enhancement

## Next Steps
- Phase 5b: Checksum Database (v0.0.36)
  - SQLite-based persistent checksum storage
  - 10-100x speedup for --checksum re-syncs
  - Automatic cache invalidation on mtime/size change
- Phase 5c: --verify-only mode (v0.0.37)
  - Audit file integrity without modification
  - Scriptable with JSON output + exit codes
- Compression auto-detection (backlog)

## Blockers
None currently

## Performance Metrics
- Localâ†’Local: 1.3x - 8.8x faster than rsync
- Delta sync (100MB file): ~4x faster (320 MB/s vs 84 MB/s)
- COW strategy (APFS): 5-9x faster than rsync
- Parallel transfers: Scales well with concurrent operations
