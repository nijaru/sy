# Status

_Last Updated: 2025-10-21_

## Current State
- Version: v0.0.34
- Phase: Moving into Phase 2 (Verification & Reliability)
- Test Coverage: 314 tests passing
- Build: Passing (CI running)
- Performance: 1.3x - 8.8x faster than rsync (see docs/PERFORMANCE.md)

## Implemented Features
- ✅ Local and remote (SSH) sync
- ✅ Delta sync with COW optimization (v0.0.23)
- ✅ Filesystem-aware strategy selection
- ✅ Hard link preservation
- ✅ Parallel file transfers
- ✅ Compression (zstd)
- ✅ Progress display with colors
- ✅ Gitignore awareness
- ✅ JSON output
- ✅ Config profiles
- ✅ Watch mode
- ✅ Resume support
- ✅ Performance monitoring (--perf flag, v0.0.33)
- ✅ Comprehensive error reporting (v0.0.34)

## What Worked
- **Local delta sync optimization** (v0.0.23): Using simple block comparison instead of rolling hash for local→local sync achieved 5-9x speedup
- **COW-aware strategies**: Automatic filesystem detection and strategy selection prevents data corruption
- **Performance monitoring**: Arc<Mutex<PerformanceMonitor>> with atomic counters provides thread-safe metrics without overhead
- **Error collection**: Collecting errors in Vec<SyncError> during parallel execution gives users comprehensive view of all failures
- **Documentation reorganization**: Following agent-contexts v0.1.1 patterns with docs/architecture/ and ai/ separation provides clear structure and knowledge graduation path
- **Comprehensive documentation**: Documenting new features (--perf, error reporting) immediately after implementation helps users discover and use them

## What Didn't Work
- QUIC transport: 45% slower than TCP on fast networks (>600 Mbps) - documented in DESIGN.md
- Compression on local/high-speed: CPU bottleneck negates benefits above 4Gbps
- Initial sparse file tests: Had to make filesystem-agnostic due to varying FS support

## Active Work
- Just completed documentation updates for v0.0.33-34 features
  - Documented --perf flag in README with examples
  - Documented error reporting in README
  - Created comprehensive troubleshooting guide

## Next Steps
- Phase 5 features (see docs/MODERNIZATION_ROADMAP.md):
  - Pre-transfer checksums
  - Verification enhancements
  - Compression auto-detection

## Blockers
None currently

## Performance Metrics
- Local→Local: 1.3x - 8.8x faster than rsync
- Delta sync (100MB file): ~4x faster (320 MB/s vs 84 MB/s)
- COW strategy (APFS): 5-9x faster than rsync
- Parallel transfers: Scales well with concurrent operations

See docs/PERFORMANCE.md and docs/EVALUATION_v0.0.28.md for detailed benchmarks.
