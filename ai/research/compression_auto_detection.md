# Compression Auto-Detection Research

**Date**: 2025-10-22
**Status**: Design Complete
**Version**: v0.0.37 (planned)

## Research Summary

### Modern Approaches (2025)

#### BorgBackup
- Uses `auto,C[,L]` mode for intelligent compression
- Tests compressibility with LZ4 first (heuristic)
- If data compresses well → applies configured compression algorithm
- If incompressible → uses no compression
- **Content-based**, not filename-based

#### Restic
- `--compression auto` mode (default)
- Uses zstd algorithm
- Content-based detection
- Users have requested file-type filtering, suggesting current auto mode doesn't use extensions

#### Meta's OpenZL (2025)
- Format-aware compression framework
- Training process that updates compression plans based on data samples
- Monitors use cases, samples periodically, re-trains

### Entropy Analysis Findings

**Thresholds**:
- Entropy > 98% (or ~7.8 bits/byte) → likely compressed/encrypted
- Entropy > 7.2 bits/byte → 50% of malware samples (compressed payloads)

**Limitations**:
- Cannot reliably distinguish compressed from encrypted data
- Many compressed files have entropy close to 8 bits/byte
- False positives when detecting encrypted content
- Unreliable with limited samples (<4KB)

**Conclusion**: Entropy analysis alone is insufficient. Sample compression testing is more reliable.

### Rust Libraries

1. **infer** (https://github.com/bojand/infer)
   - Small crate for file/MIME type detection via magic numbers
   - no_std and no_alloc support
   - Custom matchers support
   - Updated 2025

2. **tree_magic_mini**
   - MIME type detection from files or byte streams
   - Fork with performance improvements
   - Updated dependencies (2025)
   - Uses magic number database

## Design Decision

### Chosen Approach: Sample Compression Test

**Rationale**: BorgBackup's approach is proven in production and provides accurate results.

**Implementation**:
1. Keep existing extension-based filtering (fast path)
2. For unknown/compressible extensions:
   - Read first 64KB of file
   - Compress with LZ4 (23 GB/s = ~3μs for 64KB)
   - Calculate compression ratio
   - If ratio < 0.9 → use Zstd for full file
   - If ratio >= 0.9 → no compression

**Compression Ratio Threshold**: 0.9 (10% savings minimum)
- Below 10% savings, compression overhead not worth it
- Matches BorgBackup's implicit threshold

### Alternative Approaches Considered

**Option 1: Entropy Analysis**
- ❌ False positives
- ❌ Can't distinguish compressed from encrypted
- ❌ Unreliable for small samples
- ✅ No external dependencies

**Option 2: Magic Number Detection + Entropy**
- ✅ Best accuracy for known types
- ✅ Falls back to entropy for unknown
- ❌ Requires new dependency (infer)
- ❌ Entropy still unreliable

**Option 3: Sample Compression (Zstd level 1)**
- ✅ Tests actual target algorithm
- ❌ Slower than LZ4 for testing
- ❌ Less separation from production compression

**Option 4: Sample Compression (LZ4)** ✅ **CHOSEN**
- ✅ Proven approach (BorgBackup)
- ✅ Fast (23 GB/s, minimal overhead)
- ✅ Accurate (directly measures compressibility)
- ✅ No new dependencies
- ❌ Minor overhead (acceptable)

## Implementation Plan

### 1. Add Content Sampling Function

```rust
/// Detect file compressibility by sampling first 64KB
/// Returns compression ratio (compressed_size / original_size)
/// Ratio < 0.9 means compressible (>10% savings)
pub fn detect_compressibility(file_path: &Path) -> io::Result<f64> {
    const SAMPLE_SIZE: usize = 64 * 1024; // 64KB

    let mut file = File::open(file_path)?;
    let mut buffer = vec![0u8; SAMPLE_SIZE];
    let bytes_read = file.read(&mut buffer)?;

    if bytes_read == 0 {
        return Ok(1.0); // Empty file, no benefit
    }

    let sample = &buffer[..bytes_read];
    let compressed = compress_lz4(sample)?;

    Ok(compressed.len() as f64 / sample.len() as f64)
}
```

### 2. Add CLI Flag

```rust
/// Compression detection mode
#[derive(Clone, Copy, Debug, PartialEq, Eq, ValueEnum)]
pub enum CompressionDetection {
    /// Content-based detection with sampling (default)
    Auto,

    /// Extension-only detection (legacy)
    Extension,

    /// Always compress (override detection)
    Always,

    /// Never compress (override detection)
    Never,
}
```

### 3. Update `should_compress_adaptive()`

```rust
pub fn should_compress_smart(
    file_path: Option<&Path>,
    filename: &str,
    file_size: u64,
    is_local: bool,
    detection_mode: CompressionDetection,
) -> Compression {
    // LOCAL: Never compress
    if is_local {
        return Compression::None;
    }

    // Handle explicit overrides
    match detection_mode {
        CompressionDetection::Always => return Compression::Zstd,
        CompressionDetection::Never => return Compression::None,
        _ => {} // Continue with detection
    }

    // Skip small files
    if file_size < 1024 * 1024 {
        return Compression::None;
    }

    // Skip known compressed extensions (fast path)
    if is_compressed_extension(filename) {
        return Compression::None;
    }

    // Extension-only mode (legacy behavior)
    if detection_mode == CompressionDetection::Extension {
        return Compression::Zstd;
    }

    // Content sampling (auto mode)
    if let Some(path) = file_path {
        match detect_compressibility(path) {
            Ok(ratio) if ratio < 0.9 => Compression::Zstd,
            Ok(_) => Compression::None, // Not compressible
            Err(_) => Compression::Zstd, // Error reading, try compression
        }
    } else {
        // No file path available, fall back to extension-based
        Compression::Zstd
    }
}
```

### 4. Performance Metrics

**Expected overhead**:
- LZ4 throughput: 23 GB/s
- Sample size: 64 KB
- Sample compression time: ~3 microseconds
- Negligible for files >1MB

**Accuracy improvement**:
- Current: Extension-based only (misses compressed data without extension)
- New: Content-based detection (catches all compressed data)
- Expected false negative rate: <1% (based on BorgBackup experience)

### 5. Testing Plan

**Test cases**:
1. Plain text file → should compress
2. Pre-compressed file (gzip) without extension → should skip
3. Already compressed file with extension → should skip (fast path)
4. Binary executable → content-based decision
5. High-entropy random data → should skip
6. Low-entropy binary data → should compress
7. Empty file → should skip
8. Very small file (<1MB) → should skip

## Benefits

1. **Accuracy**: Content-based detection catches compressed data regardless of filename
2. **Performance**: Minimal overhead (<3μs per file for sampling)
3. **Bandwidth savings**: Avoids compressing incompressible data
4. **CPU savings**: Skips compression attempts on incompressible data
5. **Production-proven**: Based on BorgBackup's successful approach

## Future Enhancements

**Phase 2** (optional, v0.2+):
- Add magic number detection with `infer` crate
- Use magic numbers for fast identification of known formats
- Fall back to sample compression for unknown types
- Further reduce overhead by avoiding samples for known types

**Phase 3** (optional, v1.1+):
- Adaptive compression level based on CPU availability
- Per-file-type compression settings
- Compression statistics tracking
- User-configurable compression ratio threshold
